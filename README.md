# Klaviyo's OpenAPI Specification

This repo contains versioned copies of our [OpenAPI spec](openapi/stable.json).

This is the same spec we use to generate our [API Docs](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/reference/), as well as our latest [SDKs](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/docs/sdk_overview).

You can find the general spec (and soon, SDK/language-specific specs) in the `openapi` folder

You can find our [LEGACY spec here](https://klaviyo-openapi.s3.amazonaws.com/spec.json).
